coarse:   4degree increment 40deg samples total 1000
          prediction very poor
fine:     1deg increment45deg samples total 45x45x45 samples
           pass1:   shuffled keys 
           pass2:   ... redo with using end of pass1
           pass3:   ... redo using end of pass1 ... very shuffled input this time

r20000:   Intermediate result saved for the big data set

big data set is trained with shuffled keys unlike coarse one

small images data set generated ... training with different sgd values
Loss function too high for .001 ... but for .01 to 1 it is small but no
monotonic trend. Looks very flat noisy.
