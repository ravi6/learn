coarse:   4degree increment 40deg samples total 1000
          prediction very poor
fine:     1deg increment45deg samples total 45x45x45 samples
           pass1:   shuffled keys 
           pass2:   ... redo with using end of pass1

r20000:   Intermediate result saved for the big data set

big data set is trained with shuffled keys unlike coarse one
