To Debug:
Step 1:
      /usr/bin/st-util &  (runs in background)  
      This will create a port for debugging 4242
      
Step 2:
     /usr/bin/arm-eabi-none-gdb  -x=gdbinit app.elf 

While eveyrthing can be done interactively, I use gdbinit
to do some basic chores  such as
   ... conneting to the debugger port 
   ... start logging session
   ... executing any other commands 
   ... We can also source cmds   



#Contents of gdbinit
#target extended-remote localhost:4242
#set logging on
