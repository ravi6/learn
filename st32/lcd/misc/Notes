The above test showed that I could never get AF. Why?

/*NB. 8 phases are needed to be able control each segment 
of half digit controlled by one single segment line with
four common lines. The RMS of each subsegment can now be
properly be set independantly thus allowing all possible
combinations (16) of segments display
The time split and careful choice of duty provides the degrees
of freedom to change RMS with constraints on DC bias and 
off state RMS values.

💡A SEG waveform is NOT just “COM ± something”
  It is an independent time-shaped waveform whose 
  average squared difference matters.
💡Increasing phases adds time-domain degrees of freedom
💡Four RMS voltage requirement for [com-seg]. With 8 phases
  we get four more degrees of freedom that enable 16 subsegment
  combination light up with proper choice of com table and
  selection of segTable for each state.
    1.  DC blance   Sum(Ci) over phases = constant
    2.  RMS value between Ci-Cj (for i!=j) should be small and same
        gives uniform off RMS for all segments
    3.  Additional phases allow RMS energy distribution allowing
        discrimination (explain it a bit better :))
    4.  Keep number of voltage levels constant 
  The above turns into a optimization problem  with constraints.
  ChatGPT did come up with the optimal solution. And I am happy
  to accept it for now.

  Lack of above understanding lead to a long and frustrating saga
  with this project. Tried to do it with just four phases and
  inverting seg based on com states. That is only good for static 
  driving not for multiplexed (4 mux, 1/3 bias).
